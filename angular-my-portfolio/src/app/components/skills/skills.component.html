      <p>
        I have developed a strong foundation in <b>Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)</b>, solving over 
        <b>400 problems on LeetCode</b>. This journey has deepened my understanding of key algorithmic concepts such as 
        dynamic programming, recursion, graph theory, and greedy algorithms — helping me approach real-world problems with an 
        optimized and analytical mindset.

      <p>
        My primary programming languages are <b>Python</b> and <b>Java</b>, where I’m confident in building efficient, 
        scalable, and maintainable codebases. On the backend, I work extensively with <b>Spring Boot</b>, 
        focusing on creating robust APIs, integrating databases, and ensuring security and performance in enterprise-level applications.
      </p>

      <p>
        On the frontend, I use <b>Angular</b> to craft dynamic, responsive, and elegant user interfaces with a focus on 
        smooth user experience and component-driven architecture. My full-stack expertise enables me to bridge the gap between 
        design and functionality effectively.
