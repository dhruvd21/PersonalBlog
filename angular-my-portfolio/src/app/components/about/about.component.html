      <mat-card-title>Hi, I’m Dhruv</mat-card-title>

      <p>
        I am a passionate <b>Full Stack Developer</b> currently working full-time at <b>LTIMindtree</b>, where I contribute to building, optimizing, and deploying scalable web solutions that deliver real business impact. 
        I completed my <b>Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech)</b> from <b>VIT Bhopal University</b>, where I developed a strong foundation in computer science principles, software design, and modern web technologies.
      </p>

      <p>
        Over the years, I’ve become proficient in <b>Python</b> and <b>Java</b>, and I frequently use frameworks like <b>Spring Boot</b> for backend development. 
        My experience includes working with both monolithic and microservice-based architectures, implementing RESTful APIs, and integrating secure cloud solutions using AWS services. 
        I have also developed several full-stack projects using <b>Angular</b> and <b>TypeScript</b>, which helped me refine my skills in creating responsive, user-friendly, and efficient front-end interfaces.
      </p>

      <p>
        I enjoy solving real-world problems through technology — from designing optimized database schemas to implementing seamless API integrations. 
        My work philosophy revolves around writing clean, maintainable code and continuously improving performance and scalability. 
        I believe in understanding the bigger picture of a project — how frontend, backend, and cloud infrastructure come together to form a unified, reliable application.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beyond technical skills, I value collaboration, continuous learning, and adaptability. 
        Whether I’m contributing to team projects, mentoring peers, or exploring new frameworks, I always strive to deliver meaningful solutions and improve with every challenge. 
        My long-term goal is to grow into a versatile software engineer capable of designing and architecting large-scale systems that make a difference.
